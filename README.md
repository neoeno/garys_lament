# Gary's Lament

If you're on this page you're probably sneaking around to see what I'm up to.

This is an RPG I've made. Mostly.

I wrote this first in JS, Redux, and a few other techniques I wanted to play
with â€” but I'm no experienced game dev so I decided to rewrite in Lua &
[Defold](http://www.defold.com/). Turns out Defold isn't much of an RPG engine
but I've reached feature parity with the JS version at least! And a few more
things.

I've been learning a bunch throughout and each time I come back to the codebase
I end up realising I've missed an important game dev/lua/Defold idiom and end
up refactoring for a few hours. Refactoring this codebase is sort of a
recreational pursuit at the moment. I think I kind of enjoy it and there's no
one who really needs this thing so I've agreed with myself that that's OK.
